# CPSC 453: Assignment 3
**By: Dominic Choi**

## About
Moon orbiting Earth orbiting the Sun, on a backdrop of stars

Sphere was generated using a modified of my B-Spline Algorithm and a modified Surface of Revolution from Assignment 3 to include the Normals calculation.

Github Copilot was used throughout the assignment, but was very unhelpful for Animation and Shading lol

For Shading, I used the following resources
